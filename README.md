This definitions file is mostly handwritten, so it's not entirely complete.

## Notes

### Namespaces are 'classes'

Namespaces are annotated as classes, because this makes them immutable and will
make VSCode bitch about non-existing methods. Which is a good thing, because it
will highlight missing definitions or potential errors in the code.
